INSTRUCTIONS:

Prepare the beef:
1. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add beef shank and tendon, boil for 5 minutes to remove impurities. This step is crucial for a clear broth. Drain and rinse the beef under cold water, discarding the blanching water.

Build the aromatic base:
2. Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the star anise, cinnamon stick, Sichuan peppercorns, and dried chilies. Fry for about 1 minute until incredibly fragrant.

3. Add the smashed garlic, ginger coins, and scallion pieces. Stir-fry for another 2 minutes until the aromatics are golden and fragrant.

4. Push the aromatics to the side and add the doubanjiang to the oil. Fry for 30 seconds, stirring constantly to prevent burning. The oil should turn a deep red color.

Braise the beef:
5. Add the blanched beef to the pot. Stir to coat with the aromatics. Add the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice wine, and rock sugar. Toss everything together until the meat is evenly coated.

6. Add the quartered tomatoes and tomato paste. Pour in the water - it should just cover the meat. Bring to a boil.

7. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours. The beef should be fork-tender but not falling apart. Tendon will need the full 3 hours to become gelatinous.

Prepare the noodles and vegetables:
8. About 15 minutes before serving, bring a large pot of water to boil. Cook noodles according to package directions until just al dente. Drain and divide among serving bowls.

9. In the same water, blanch the bok choy for 1-2 minutes until bright green and just tender. Drain well.

Assemble and serve:
10. Strain the broth if desired for a cleaner presentation, or serve rustic-style with all the aromatics. Taste and adjust seasoning with more soy sauce if needed.

11. Ladle the hot broth and beef pieces over the noodles. Top each bowl with bok choy, suan cai, fresh cilantro, and sliced scallions. Drizzle with chili oil for extra heat.

COOK'S NOTES:
- The quality of your doubanjiang makes a huge difference. Look for Pixian brand from Sichuan.
- Don't skip the blanching step - it removes blood and impurities for a cleaner-tasting broth.
- The broth can be made 1-2 days ahead and refrigerated. The flavors will deepen.
- Beef tendon is traditional and adds wonderful texture, but the dish is still delicious without it.
