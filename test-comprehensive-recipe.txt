  Equipment needed: Stand mixer with dough hook, rolling pin, bench scraper, pastry
   brush, baking sheets, parchment paper, ruler

  For the Dough (Détrempe):
  - 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
  - 1/4 cup granulated sugar
  - 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  - 1 cup whole milk, warmed to 110°F
  - 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
  - 2 tablespoons water, cold

  For the Butter Block (Beurrage):
  - 1 1/4 cups unsalted European-style butter, cold (high fat content 82-84%)
  - 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

  For the Egg Wash:
  - 1 large egg
  - 1 tablespoon heavy cream
  - 1 pinch salt (optional)

  Instructions:
  1. In the stand mixer bowl, combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Mix briefly to
   combine. Add warm milk, melted butter, and cold water.
  2. Using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed for 3 minutes until dough
  comes together. Increase to medium speed and knead for 5 minutes until smooth and
   elastic.
  3. Shape dough into a rectangle about 1 inch thick, wrap tightly in plastic wrap,
   and refrigerate for 1 hour to relax gluten.
  4. Prepare butter block: Place cold butter between two sheets of parchment paper.
   Pound with rolling pin to flatten, then roll into an 8x8 inch square. Sprinkle
  with flour and fold to incorporate. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  5. Roll chilled dough into a 10x16 inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface.
  Place butter block in center, fold dough over to enclose butter completely,
  pressing edges to seal.
  6. Roll the dough-butter package into a 10x20 inch rectangle, maintaining
  straight edges. Perform a letter fold (fold bottom third up, top third down).
  This is the first turn. Wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.
  7. Repeat step 6 two more times (for a total of 3 turns), chilling 30 minutes
  between each turn. After the final turn, refrigerate for at least 4 hours or
  overnight.
  8. Roll the laminated dough into a 10x30 inch rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
  Use a ruler and sharp knife to cut into long triangles with a 4-inch base.
  9. Make a small notch at the base of each triangle. Gently stretch the dough,
  then roll from base to point, tucking the point underneath. Curve into a crescent
   shape.
  10. Place croissants on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 3 inches apart.
  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and proof at room temperature for 2-3 hours until
   doubled and jiggly when tray is gently shaken.
  11. Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk together egg, cream, and salt for egg wash.
  Gently brush croissants with egg wash, being careful not to deflate.
  12. Bake for 18-22 minutes, rotating pans halfway through, until deep golden
  brown and crispy. Let cool on wire racks for at least 10 minutes before serving.

  Admin Notes: This recipe requires precision for lamination - butter and dough
  must be the same consistency to prevent butter breakthrough. Temperature control
  is critical: if butter melts during rolling, refrigerate immediately. The dough
  can be frozen after step 7 for up to 1 month. Croissants are best eaten the day
  they're baked but can be refreshed in a 350°F oven for 5 minutes.
