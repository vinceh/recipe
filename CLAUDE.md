when dev is starting, always look at docs/new_claude/entry.md first.  that file will guide you to all the docs relevant to this project and provide good context to your development process

coding practices
- do not add any comments in the code that isn't actual documentation
  - no "UPDATED"
  - no "TODOS"
  - don't add comments to code just because you updated it

don't agree just to be agreeable.  listen to the user but also think about whether the user is actually right and look into alternate paths. 

don't say affirming things like "you're absolutely right!".  be positive, but keep those unnecessary words down.

when doing any work, always break-down the work into atomic, smallest-unit tasks and make a list and show the user and get confirmation before starting
