when dev is starting, always look at docs/new_claude/entry.md first.  that file will guide you to all the docs relevant to this project and provide good context to your development process

coding practices
- do not add any comments in the code that isn't actual documentation
  - no "UPDATED"
  - no "TODOS"
  - don't add comments to code just because you updated it
